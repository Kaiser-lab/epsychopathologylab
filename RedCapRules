RedCap rules for every new participant:
- On the left of the page, go to Add/Edit records. Choose to add a new participant.
- A RedCap number will be automatically attributed (e.g., 6). In order to modify it to
our own classification, one must first go to the "Visit" questionnaire, enter date of data entry, complete the form (scroll through
at the bottom of the page) and save and exit. Then, go to "Choose action for record" => "Rename record" and add the participant's code.
- You can start completing the next questionnaires.
- Always choose to complete a form when it is completed. Don't leave a form incomplete for days on.
- For every questionnaire where the sum of points is pre-calculated, make sure that the given value makes sense. This is especially
important for the BNSS where some answers have unrelated values ("Non Ã©valuable" = 9).
- Some questions requiring a text answer are required but can have a null value (e.g., how many cigarettes do you smoke in a day?"). If
the answer is none/no/no answer, write N/A.
